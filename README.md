# Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction

## *Project Overview*
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a credit card company using machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service, enabling targeted customer retention strategies.

---

## *Features*
- **Data Analysis:** Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and relationships within the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, feature selection, and data transformations.
- **Modeling:** Trained multiple machine learning models for churn prediction.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## *Tech Stack*
- **Programming Language:** *Python*
- **Libraries:**
  - *NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation*
  - *Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization*
  - *Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation metrics*

---

## *Dataset*
The dataset used for this project contains information about customers, such as:
- Customer demographics
